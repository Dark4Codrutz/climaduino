These files are installed on the Arduino Yún. They interact with the Climaduino code using the bridge
library. The code uses MQTT to both publish the current readings as well as to retreive new readings.

** Note: Please update the software on your Arduino Yún before following the steps below. http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/YunSysupgrade

The process to install these files on the Yún are as follows:
- SSH into the Yún (username root, password is whatever you set)

- update opkg
-- opkg update

-- install distribute (easy_install)
-- opkg install python-openssl
-- opkg install distribute

- Install the Paho MQTT client
-- easy_install paho-mqtt

- Install screen
-- opkg install screen

- Optionally install SFTP to make it easier to transfer and edit files
-- opkg install openssh-sftp-server

- edit so going to right MQTT broker

- place receive_settings.py and send_settings.py in /root on the Arduino Yún

- edit /etc/rc.local and add the following line before the line 'exit 0':
-- screen -d -m -S mqtt_bridge python /root/mqtt_bridge.py

- to improve reliability and reboot the Arduino part of the Yún when the Linux
part is rebooted, do the following (copied from http://playground.arduino.cc/Hardware/Yun#rebootStability):
	Make a new file called /bin/reboot with following content

	reset-mcu
	/sbin/reboot

	make the file executable

	chmod +x /bin/reboot

- mDNS resolution on Yún not currently working... edit /etc/hosts and add (replace <controller_ip>)
-- <controller_ip> climaduino.local

- reboot the Yún
-- reboot

## Stuff I'm not sure we really want to do...
- Install the python serial library
-- easy_install pySerial

- Disable console on serial - we want the Python to directly interface with the Arduino
code over serial. The serial port is otherwise in use and unavailable to us. Note: this
will disable the Arduino bridge library.
-- vi /etc/inittab
-- down arrow 3 times
-- press i
-- you should be at the following line ttyATH0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
-- press #
-- press esc
-- press :wq

- reboot the Linux part of the Yún
-- reboot
